## Technical Details

### Loan Engine API

```typescript
import { LoanEngine, LoanParameters } from './engine/LoanEngine';

// Create a loan
const params: LoanParameters = {
  principal: 25000,
  interestRate: 6.5,
  termMonths: 60,
  interestType: 'FIXED',
  paymentFrequency: 'MONTHLY',
  fees: {
    originationFee: 1.5,
    processingFee: 299
  }
};

// Calculate
const engine = new LoanEngine(params);
const result = engine.calculate();

console.log(result.monthlyPayment); // Monthly payment amount
console.log(result.apr); // Annual percentage rate
console.log(result.paymentSchedule); // Full amortization schedule
```

### Interest Types

1. **Fixed Interest**: Traditional amortizing loan
2. **Variable Interest**: Simulates rate changes every 6 months
3. **Compound Interest**: Calculates with specified compounding frequency

## Limitations

Since demo mode runs entirely in the browser:

- No data persistence (refreshing loses changes)
- No real backend integration
- No document uploads
- No email notifications
- No multi-user collaboration

## Development

### Adding New Demo Data

Edit `/frontend/src/demo/demoData.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEMO_LOANS: DemoLoan[] = [
  // Add new demo loans here
];

export const DEMO_CUSTOMERS: DemoCustomer[] = [
  // Add new demo customers here
];
```

### Extending the Engine

The loan engine is in `/frontend/src/engine/LoanEngine.ts`. You can:

- Add new interest calculation methods
- Implement additional fee structures
- Add new payment frequencies
- Create custom calculation scenarios

## Transitioning to Full Mode

To switch from demo to full mode:

1. Set up the backend (MongoDB, Redis, etc.)
2. Update environment variables:
   ```env
   VITE_DEMO_MODE=false
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1
   ```
3. Run both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:all
   ```
